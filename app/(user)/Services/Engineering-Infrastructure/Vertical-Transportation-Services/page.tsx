          In today&apos;s fast-moving world, vertical transportation systems,
          elevators, escalators, and moving walkways are more than just
          utilities; they are essential to the functionality and efficiency of
          buildings and public infrastructure. From office towers to transit
          hubs, airports to hospitals, vertical mobility shapes how people
          interact with the built environment.
