              What Are Alternative Delivery Models?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Alternative Delivery Models (ADMs) are innovative methods of
              executing construction and infrastructure projects that integrate
              planning, design, financing, and construction in more flexible and
              collaborative ways. Unlike the traditional design-bid-build
              process, these approaches streamline workflows, reduce
              fragmentation, and encourage team alignment from day one.
